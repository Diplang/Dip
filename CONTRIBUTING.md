# I'm glad you want to contribute to Dip!

As this project is in an extremely early stage, and has been made by a high-schooler who has no idea how open-source works, I suggest you should play around with the language a little bit, find any bugs, and add them as issues, and I will get to them as soon as I can. If you're kind enough to stick around after this step, I'd be really grateful if you could merge a pull request or two!
